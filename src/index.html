            I'm Gianfranco, a passionate <b>Web Developer</b> focused on <b>Frontend Development</b>. I like to build smart user interfaces using modern
            <b>Javascript</b> frameworks and libraries, like <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a> and
            <a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stencil</a>, but also using simple <b>Vanilla Javascript</b>.

            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=glaamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaamy</a>. I worked both on web and mobile side, building Javascript Single

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appcelerator_Titanium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titanium Appcelerator</a>.
