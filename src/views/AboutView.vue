        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm born in Nuoro (<span class="phonetic" title="N√πoro"> /Àànu.oro/</span>), Sardinia, in <b>1989</b>. I
          grew up in
          Orosei and after graduating from high school I moved to Pisa and then to Cagliari, where I currently live and
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a curious person who likes to learn. I like to understand how things work around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love technology. As a child I alternated between living outdoors and gaming sessions with my Super Nintendo.
          My love for video games is what drove me to become a programmer when I grew up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love writing code. Programming for me has always been an <b>art</b> to be used to create something that works and has
          a purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love nature. My grandparents were farmers and ranchers and I grew up in a small town near the sea and
          surrounded by the countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love music. I like to strum the guitar now and then (classical and acoustic) but I have to say I'm not very
          good at it.
